# Component Based Architecture

- *Component Based Architectrue* focuses on the decomposition of components of web page 
    - It breaks down the functionality of the page into smaller key parts 

- The main focus of component based architecture is the `component resuability`
    - This concept is in description of the resuability of the software for the component. 

- `Component Oriented` Software is more functional and cost efficient than object oriented software 

## What is a Component? 

- `Component` is a software object that interacts with other objects which posses different functionalities. 

- **Here are 3 views of Components**

    - `Object-Oriented` 
      - Viewed as a set of one more operating classes and defines all attributes and methods. 
    - `Conventional` 
      - Functional model that intergates processing logic
    - `Process-related`
      - System builds pre existing components from libraries. 

- *Characteristics Of Components* 

    - `Resuability`
    - `Replaceable`
    - `Not Context Specific`
    - `Extensible`
    - `Encapsulated`
    - `Indepedent`

- Component Designs are extremely efficient and should be implented more in creating code.


# What is Props and How to use it in React? 

- `React` is a component based library and it uses `props` to send data through components. 

- `Props` stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another component. 

- The flow of data is only `uni-directional`
    - It moves from the parent to child. 

## Using Props step by step 

1. Define attributes and its data
2. Pass data from parent to child by using `Props`
3. Render `Props` data

- **It is important to note that using `Props` does take some time and practice but it does become more natural after a number of uses** 

- It also a cleaner way to write code, making it more efficent and easier on the eyes of someone else reading your code. 


## Things I want to know more about

- I want to better understand both of these concepts since I do feel a bit lost in the description. 
    - I will definitely be watching more videos to understand the concepts and obtain a better grasp on the concepts in the future.
