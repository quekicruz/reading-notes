# SQL vs NoSQL 

### High Level Differences 

- `SQL databases differences`
    - Primarly called `Relational Databases(RDBMS);`
    - Table base databases 
    - Represents data in form of tables which consists of rows and columns
    - Have predefined schema
    - Vertically scalable 
    - Scaled by increasinf horse-power of hardware

- `NoSQL databases differences`
  - Primaly called `non-relational or distributed database`
  - Is document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
  - Represents data as a collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide column stores
  - have dynamic schema for unstructured data. 
  - Horizontally scalable 
  - Scaled by increasing databases servers in the pool. 


- `SQL databases are a good fit for the complex query intensive environment`

- `Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents.`

- **NoSQL is a better fit for the hierarchual data storage as it follwos the key-value pair way of storing datat similar to JSON data.**

- **SQL is the best for scalability**


## Video Information 

- `SQL`
  - Structured Query Language
    - Allows for the writing of database queries 
      - Needs specific keywords and syntax queries 
        - Has a Strong Schema and Relational Database

- `Relational Database`
  - Database that works with the assumption to support the SQL language 
    - It could work with a table for example to store data within the table 
    - Allows for multiple tables to work well with each other
    - Different Types of Relations 
      - `One-to-One`
      - `One-to-many`
      - `Many-to-many`

- `Schema` 
    - Fields that contain the information for the SQL 
    - Creates a clear path for the information to move 

- `NoSQL` 
  - The `MongoDb`(Humongos) World usually referred
  - Have Collections within to hold information
  - Documents doesn't need the same schema, not required for strict
  - It is more flexible in its data structure and no relation/few relations in the NoSQL world
  - 

# Who Wins? 

- It really depends on the type of application you are building 
- `NoSQL` has the disadvantage of containing data all in one area and its scaling ability has the issue of being limited by vertical scaling.
