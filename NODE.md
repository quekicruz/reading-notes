# Intro To Node.js

- What is `Node.js`?
  - Multiple definitions for it 
    - `Node.js` is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's v8 JavaScript Engine 
    - `Node.js` is an event-based, non=blocking, asynchronous I?O runtime that uses Googles v8 JavaScritpt engine 

- `V8 Engine`
    - open source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web broswers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. 
    - `Node.js` is a program in V8 Engine we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. 

- Installing Node
  - It is recommended to install a version manager instead
  - It allows for the download of multiple versions of node 

- `npm install` `-g jshint`
  - This command allows the installation of the jshnit package globally on your system. 
  - It will help us find ES6 errors 


- Node.js has excellent compability with modern javascript and works very well its syntax. 

- `NPM` 
  - package manager for node 
  - to check which version you have run `npm-v`

- Uses for `Node.js`
  - there are tools to help build modern javascript applications 

- `Node.js` is event driven and allows for asynchronous behavior 

- `Node Execution Model`
  1. Node apps pass async tasks to the event loop, along with a callback 
  2. The event loop efficiently manages a thread pool and executes tasks efficently 
  3. Executes each callbackss as tasks complete 

- Since `node` runs in a single thread there are some potential downsides 
  - errors need to be handled correctly

- Apps built with `Node.js`
  - They are apps that allow for real time interaction
  - Also good for sites that require data streaming capabilities 

- Advantages of `Node.js`
  - The language is very straight forward and other languages aren't necessary. 
  - Javascript is `ubiquitous`
    - Transitioning to Node is much easier 
    - JavaScript is challenging at first but when it clicks it all makes sense 


# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 

- Here are the `6` reasons for pair programming
  1. Greater Efficiency 
  2. Engaged Collaboration 
  3. Learning from fellow students 
  4. Social Skills 
  5. Job interview readiness 
  6. Work environment readiness 

- The best reason for myself personally would have to be the `engaged collaboration` aspect. 
  - I feel that I learned and others learn from each other in this process which I find extremely beneficial. 

- The way that pair programming works is that there is a `driver` and `navigator` 
  - The 2 developers will decided which will be who first and depending on roles the tasks varies. 
  - `Driver` has the responbility of listening to the navigator and inputting the code that the navigator states out or fixes any syntax errors 
  - `Navigator` has the responbility of telling the driver what to code down and guiding the driver through the coding processing 
  - Even the roles may seem strict both developers are free to provide input to come to the best solution for their specific task or project
  - Typically, time limits will be set to have both individuals switch off on roles. 


##  Things I want to know more about 

  - I believe the biggest thing for me would have to be understanding node a bit more in depth and feeling more confident in that specific area.
