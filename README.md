# What is Growth Mindset to Me? 

>It is always doing your best even when failure may come your way and always trying again until you succeed

## Who Am I?

*My name is Quentin Napu Ueki Cruz, I also go by Q. I am a Guam native that moved to Washington to pursue a degree in Kinesiology which I accomplished in 2019 but due to recent circumstances I have decided to do a complete career change. My interest in coding/software engineering started with the help of one my roommates and it was then solidified after I took the 101 course designed by Code Fellows. It is now my dream to become a full stack developer to assist in the healthcare and fitness industry.*

### Here are 3 daily reminders that I use for myself to stay in a Growth Mindset

1. **I always think about my family and how successful family members have become by always doing their absolute best.**
2. **I always make sure to give myself breaks to avoid BURNOUT.** 
4. **Always refering back to my favorite Michael Jordan quote and it goes:**
> I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
