# How Google Learned From its Quest to Build the Perfect Team 

* [This](class-14b.md) link will bring you to my notes on this specific subject 

# How I explained `REST` to my brother 

- Roy fielding help create `HTTP` and created `REST`
    - `REST` 
      - Architectural style that the web is built on
      - It provides a resource for where things are in the web 
      - 

- The techinques don't work well because the machine can't understand it as efficiently and not every machine understands it enough 

- The HTTP protocol that fielding and his colleagues created was 

    - `GET`
        - The specific HTTP that grabs images from different resources for those images to appear on the webpage 
        - It is a very important verb
    - `POST`
        - System adding other resource to another system 
    - `PUT`
        - If system wants to replace something in another system 
    - `PATCH`
        - Will do a partial update 


## Things I want to know more about 

- I want to better understand REST and review more of the article and atcually dive more into knowing what it actually is.
