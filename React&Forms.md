# Forms 

- `setState`: Updates mutable states in JavaScript 

- `Controlled Component`: An input form that combines the `setState` as well as form elements which is controlled by React. 
    - Input value is always handled by React state.

- `<textarea>`: in react uses value attribute to produce a single line of code 

- `<select>`: creates a drop down list 

- When dealing with multiple inputs you can add a name attribute to each element. 

# The Conditional Operator Explained 

- `Ternary Operator`
  - To write if/else in one line of code to make your easier to read. 
  - Ex: `condition ? value if true: value if false`

- `condition` 
  - Is the aspect that you're checking, the result should be `true` or `false`
- `?` 
  - Separates our conditional from our true value. 
  - anything between the `?` and `:` is what is executed if the condition is true 
- `:` 
  - if the condition evalutates to false, any code runs after the `:`

- `Nested Ternary`
  - Nesting can occur to test multiple conditions 

- Class Example
  - `x===y ? true: false`


## Things I want to know more about 

- I definitely want to practice with ternary operators, they seem to make life a lot easier but I want to make sure I am understanding and doing it correctly. 

- I also want to work more in forms and see what else I can do in React.
