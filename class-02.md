## How does CSS work?

**CSS allows us to control how HTML will look on a webpage**

**CSS needs 2 important aspects: a selector and declaration** 

**Declarations** are made up of a property and value

- To connect CSS to our HTML we need a '<link>' present to allow for styling to take place

#### CSS Selectors

1. Universal selector 
2. Type selector 
3. Class selector 
4. ID selector 
5. Child selector 
6. Descendant selector 
7. Adjacent selector 
8. General sibling selector 

## Javascript Instructions 

- For a script there is steps or instructions known as **statements**

- Note: JavaScript is case sensitive, meaning different code lines mean different things 

- **Comments** are used to help an individual reading your code to better understand what it does

- **Variables** store temporary data that is needed for the script 

#### Data Types 

1. Numeric
2. String Data
3. Boolean

#### Rules for naming variables 

1. Name must begin with a letter, $, or (_). Not start with a number 
2. Name can contain numbers, but must use dash or period to make it connect
3. Cannot use **keywords** or **reserved** words
4. All variables are case sensitive 
5. Be descriptive of your variable name 
6. Use camelcase: userName

##### Array 

- Stores a list of values 


##### Different Expressions 

1. Assign a value to a variable 
2. Use 2 or more values to return a single value 

##### Operators 

- Allow the creation of a single value from 2 or more values 

## Decisions & Loops 

- **Decisions** are needed in specific areas of a script, one way to help visualize where that will take place is with the use of a **flowchart**

##### 2 Components of a decision 

1. Expression evaluated= return to a value 

2. Conditional statement says what to do in a given situation
