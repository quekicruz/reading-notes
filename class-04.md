# Chapter 4 Links 

**Links allow for a user to jump from different websites and allowing for `surfing`the web.**

### Different types of links 

- Links from one website to another 
- Links from webpage to another 
- Links from one part of the page to another part of the page 

### How to write a link 

- The components needed: `<a>`,`href`,`</a>`
  - Ex: `<a href="http://www.github.com>GitHub</a>`

`Absolute Link`: Links one website to another website. 

`Relative Link`: Links one part of the page to another part of the page. Or to different parts of the same website 

`mailto:` Is used to start up the person's email information or contact information. 

# Chapter 15 Layout

### Key Concepts in positioning elemets

- `block-level elements`
- `inline elements`
- `containing or parent element`

### Different positioning schemes

- `Normal`: Default setting and will appear vertically down the page 

- `Realtive`: Shifts an element either to the right or left and bit to the bottom from its original position

- `Absolute`: Specific element is taken out of the normal flow and moves as the user moves up and down the page 

- `Fixed`: Form of abosulte positioning, does not move when user goes up and down page 

- `Floating`: Allows for specific element leave normal flow and becomes a block level element where text can float around it 

- `stacking context`: Puts blocks on top of one another 

### Fixed width vs Liquid 

- `Fixed Width`: Webpage does not change size as user expands page 

- `Liquid`: Allows the webpage to expand and format to the increase in size 


# Chapter 3 Functions, Methods, and Objects 

### What is a function? 

`Function`: Allows for the grouping of statements to perform a specific task 

`calling`: Description of when a specific task is used 

`parameters`: The pieces of information within the function 

`return value`: The response of the function 


### Declaring a Function 

Ex: `function sayHello(){ document.write('hello!');}`

# Article Paired Programming

`Pair Progamming`: Two developers working on code simuatoneously 

- There are 2 roles for pair programming 
  1. `Driver`: The one that is typing code
  2. `Navigator`: Manages the text-editor, switching files, version control
        - Uses words to direct the driver without any input 
        - Also scans for errors in code 
        - Also can look up different solutions 

- 4 Skills to learn a foreign lanuage 

1. `Listening`: Hearing and understand vocab 
2. `Speaking`: Using correct terminology to describe ideas
3. `Reading` : Understanding written language
4. `Writing` : Producing meaningful content 

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 

1. **Greater Efficiency**
      - Makes it easier for 2 individuals to find error in code and makes things run smoothly 
      - Higher quality of code is produced 
      - Solutions for problems can be reached much quicker 

2. **Engaged Collaboration** 
      - Higher focus when 2 individuals work on code 
      - It is also easier to ask for help and accomplish the task quicker 

3. **Learning from fellow students** 
      - Can gain new knowledge and experience from another student 
      - Improve skills and expertise in specific area of code 

4. **Social Skills** 
      - Improves communication skills 
      - Affects long term career outcomes 

5. **Job Interview readiness** 
      - Companies can get an idea of how an individual works with others to know how they will fit in company 
      - At times company look more at communication skills than technical skills 

6. **Work Environment readiness**
      - Code Fellow graduates are better equipped when entering the work industry because they are more exposed to pair programming
