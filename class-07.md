# Domain Modeling 

- Process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. 

- Talks about different attributes for the model and the behaviors of the model 

- A proper one can explain itself clearly and well to stakeholders 

- Code Example 

` let EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals){ this.epicRating = epicRating}; this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;}`

` var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7,false);`
`var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4,true);`

### Object oriented programming 

1. The `new` keyword instantiates 
2. The constructor function initalizes properties inside that object using the `this` variable 
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use 

### Number generator 

`math.Random()`

- There are a lot of different factors that go into the UI when there are multiple factors involved 

# Tables 

- Represents information in a grid format 
    - `Financial Reports`
    - `Schedules`
    - `Sports Results`

- Basic table structure 
  - `<table>`
    : Used to add tables to a page 
  - `<tr>`
    : Rows are created
  - `<td>`
    : Number of cells
  - `<th>`
    : header of table

# Functions, Methods, Objects 

`Global Scope`: function at the top of the script 

`key`: key is values in arrays and objects 

`Arrays`: special type of object, related to key/value pairs 

- You can use `arrays` and `objects` to create complex data structures 

### Built-In Objects 

- Represent browser window and current webpage shown in window

1. `Browser Object Model`: represent current browswer tab
2. `Document Object Model`: representation of current page 
3. `Global Javascript Objects`: Things that javascript need to build objects 

`Global Object`: Works anywhere in the script 

`object`: complex data type 

- Javascript built in objects
1. String, 
2. Number,
3. Math, 
4. Date 


**Arrays and Objects work hand in hand to create complex data**
