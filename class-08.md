# More CSS Layout

`Block-level element`
  - Starts on new line 
  - Ex: `<h1>`,`<p>`

`Inline Elements`
  - Flows between surrounding text 
  - Ex: `<img>`,`<b>`

`Containing Elements`
  - The outer box element if a box is inside another box

### Positions of flow 

`Normal Flow` 
- Default Behaviour 

`Relative Flow`
- It would shift it either top, bottom, left, or right 

`Absolute Flow`
- Moves as user goes up and down screens 

`Fixed Flow` 
- Relation to browser window 

`Floating Elements`
- Takes it out of flow and puts it either to the right or left 

`z-index`
- Can allow boxes to overlap one another 

### Fixed vs Liquid Layout 

`Fixed`
  - Design does not change size when user increases or decreases the size of screen 
  - It is better because it is accurate for web page 
  - It falls short because there could be potential for a lot of open space with no content 

`Liquid`
  - Design stretches as user increases and decreases size of webpage 
  - It is better because it can fill in all spaces on the page 
  - It falls short because if width is not correct it can look very strange on the page 

### CSS Frameworks 

- They are nice because they but they are not so desirable because they come with extra unnecessary code 

- You can also include nultiple css files in one page
