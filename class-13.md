# Local Storage 

- `userData` - In old browsers held up to 64 KB of information for users 

- `flash 6` - allowed for individuals to save up to 100 KB of information for users 

- `flash 8` - added more storage for users but it was an additional cost 

- `Gears` - google creation; allowed for for unlimited storage data per domain

- `HTML 5/Web Storage` - stores named key/value pairs locally within the client web broswer

- It always wise to make sure that the browser can support the system 

- Retrieving `HTML 5 Storage` is simple with keys and returning the with the same key 
    - That key is a string

- Here are some different commands for the storage 
    - `setItem`
    - `getItem`
    - `removeItem`
    - `clear`

- There are still limits with the storages and with HTML 5 that limit is `5 megabytes`

- Storing data im strings is extremely beneficial for storage systems since it is easie to understand functions 

- There are competing visions in using storage and here are a few 
    - `SQL` 
    - `Indexed Database API/WebSimpleDB`
        - Uses an object store to hold different data sets or record
