## What is Growth Mindset to Me? 

>It is always doing your best even when failure may come your way and always trying again until you succeed

### Here are 3 daily reminders that I use for myself to stay in a growth mindset state of mind

1. **I always think about my family and how successful family members have become by always doing their absolute best.**
2. **I always make sure to give myself breaks to avoid BURNOUT** 
3. **Always refering back to my favorite Michael Jordan quote and it goes:**
> I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
