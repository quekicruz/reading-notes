# This is my notes on How Computers Work 

**Computers ARE EVERYWHERE** 

### Some computers you already have

* Smart Phone 

*  Smart Watch 

*  Calculator 

### 4 Functions of Computers

1. Input 
    - Commands given to computer 

2. Storage
    - Input stored in memory 

3. Processing 
    - Uses algorithm to save memory or send off for output command

4. Output
    - Dependent on computer, some examples include controlling machines or spitting out texts

### Binary & Data 

*What is a bit?* 

It is a the smallest amount of information a computer can store. 

**More wires=More Bits**

**As a result More Bits=More Complex information**

#### Binary Number System 

* O and 1 are the only numbers
    * Posiitons are counted in 2s= Ex: 1s-2s-4s-8s

##### Text, Image, & Sounds in Binary Number System 

**ALL 3 CAN BE SHOWN AS SIMPLE AS 1 & 0**

### Circuits and logic 

**Ciruits can be perform simple logic computations such as **AND**, **NOT**,and **OR**

+ You can combine all circuits to make them more complex.

+ Adders can addit bits to make more complex models 

#### Small computers are faster because of a smaller circuit, making signals travel quicker

### Memory, CPU, & Input/Output

**Steps on how information is outputted** 

1. Information is received as typing "A"
2. CPU receives information as bits, then from memory creates pixels. 
3. Those pixels are then showed on a screen as your letter "A" which is your output

#### There are many different forms of output

### Hardware & Software 

#### What is a CPU 

- A CPU is a master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer made up of various circuits 

- A CPU fetches various binaries to carry out commands

#### The operating system of a computer with the CPU allows for various softwares to run at the same time.
