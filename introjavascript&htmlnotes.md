# Intro Notes for JavaScript & HTML

## What are the ABC of programming? 

### A 

* *What is a script and how do I use it?*

- A script is very similar to a manual for a computer and it tells the computer what needs to be done. 

* A script you can imagine almost like a recipe or handbook.

- A script tells different portions of a browser how to be interactive with its users. 

### Lets talk about writing a script

* To write a script you must first start with a goal and then you need to list a correct set of orders to achieve that goal. 

* Computers are also not like us, it needs detailed instructions to carry out its given task. 
    - *It does not go off assumption*

## Start with the Big Picture 

### Some tips to building a script 

1. Define your goal 
    - You need to where you want to go
    - This can be as simple as creating a game or puzzle to complete

2. Design your script
    - It is needed to have organization
    - This can be achieved by creating a flowsheet with all the steps required to achieve the tasks

3. Code each step 
    - This is the fun part
    - Once the 1st & 2nd step is completed you just need to code in specific language the script was meant for 

### Tasks & Steps 

- Task is the main goal and steps are the details on how to complete the task. 

### Steps & Code 

- Vocabulary- Words computers recoginze 

- Syntax- Using vocabulary to create specific instructions that the computer can follow 

**You need to "think" like a computer due to the fact that they process information differently**

## B

#### How do computers fit in the world around them? 

- *Computers use data to create models of worlds. 

- They need data in order to achieve this task since they have no concept of a world. 

- That is why programmers need the correct data/instructions to assist the computer in generating this world. 

### Objects & Properties 

**Objects** 

- Physical things in the world that can represesnted in the computer world. 
    - Types are different physical things present. 
    - Instances are how many of those physical things present.

- Each object can have its own: 
    * Properties 
    * Events 
    * Methods

**Properties**

- Characteristics of an object 

- Each property has a name and value which give a description of the specific object 

### Events & Methods 

**Events** 

- They are instance of user interaction with the web page 

- Specific events can occur depending on what the programmer wants in the script 

**Methods**

- Represent how people interact with an object in the real world. 

- In code in can represent different instructions for just one task 

- The information necessary from a method is what to interepet from the answer given

### Combine it! 

- Computers use data to create models 

- Events trigger methods

- Methods can update an objects properties

### Web Browsers/Objects 

- Window Object: Displays how many tabs are open and tells specific url for pages

- Document Object: What shows on the screen and what you see

    - Document objects represent an HTML page 
    -  It also has properties, methods, events.
    - Properties: characteristics of webpage
    - Methods: Tasks performed dependent on what is on webpage 
    - Events: User interaction with webpage

### Browser sees WebPage 
**We need to understand how browsers interpret HTML code**

1. Recieve a page as HTML code 
    - Websites=Different Documents

2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory 
    - Within documents are nodes
    - Nodes represent different objects on page

3. Use renderring engine to show the page on screen
    - Without CSS link, webpage will default to certain style
    - CSS gives design to webpage

**Knowing how HTML works now sheds light on how JavaScript is used to give instructions to a website to allow it to do different actions**

## C 

**Lets Talk About To Write Script** 

### HTML,CSS, & JavaScript

1. HTML:(.html)/ Content Layer
    - The structure of the webpage

2. CSS: (.css)/ Presentation Layer
    - The design of the webepage 

3. JavaScript: (.js)/ Behavior Layer
    - The interactiveness of webpage

### JavaScript: Objects & Methods

- JavaScript EX: 
    document.write('Good Afternoon')

- I will do my best to explain each portion of that code to the best of my ability. 

- document= Is an object that represents the entire webpage

- write()= Is method of the document 

- 'good afternoon'= Parameter is a piece of information written within method section

- That single line of JavaScript from the example is what you is referred to "calling" a method. 

### Script/JavaScript 

**JavaScript will only appear where the script link is inserted in the HTML file**
