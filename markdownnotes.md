# This is my reading notes on Markdown
### What is Markdown? 

>It is a simple way to design/implement text for a web page.

## Now there is different ways to go about with design/implementation process

### Lets begin with headers 

Headers are displayed in 6 different ways or tiers and this is showcased by the amount of pound signs presented.

It begins with Heading 1(#)being the largest heading you will and as heading numbers increase, heading size will decrease in size

Here is my example of the of different size headings:

#### This what a 4 tier heading would look like 

##### This is what a 5 tier heading looking like


### Now lets move onto some lists

My example of a list would be like so: 

1. I love to cook. 
2. I enjoy personal training. 
3. I am having a great time coding. 

To generate a list like the one above you can simply enter this: 1. (Text) 2. (Text) 3. (Text) all in a column

### The next portion we can focus on is the bold aspect of a text 

If you have not already noticed there have been some instances where you have seen bolding in action! 

The way to bold a text would be like so: 

My example: **The way the way clippers played today they looked unstoppable!** 

How to bold a text goes as follows: **(Text)** 

### Lets move forward now and talk about italics 

My example would be: *I never thought I would be doing code* 

The way to create italics would be as follows: *(Text)* 

### The next portion is how to insert an image 

Here is my example of how to insert one

**The note to be made is that you should always images that are open and free to public**

### Links are the next portion 

My example is on food: 

[Chamorro food](https://www.annieschamorrokitchen.com/chamorro-dishes/)

**Always be sure to put the text you on the page in brackets**

### The last portion I will cover are block quotes

This is an easy to quote an individual. 

How you would display this is by adding this a closed >(text) and it will appear as a quote on your page.
