# This is my notes on Operators & Loops 

## Evaluating Conditions/Comparison Operators  

* Is equal to - ==

* Is not equal to- !=

* Strict equal to- ===

* Strict not equal to- !==

* Greater than- >

* Greater than or equal to- >=

* Less than- <

* Less than or equal to- <=

**All these conditions create **Booleans** which are true or false statements** 

## Logical Operators 

*Allows to compare the results of more than one comparison operator* 

### Here are some different logical operators

* **&&**- Logical and 
    - Tests more than one condition

* **||**- Logical or
    - Tests at least one condition

* **!**- Logical not 
    - Takes a single boolean value and inverts it 

### Loops 

**What is a loop?** 

A loop runs a code block if true will run again if false it will run either 3 different loops.

#### Types of loops 

* For 
    - Runs a code a specific number of times 
* While 
    - No specifc number of times for code to run will run if statement is true 
* Do While 
    - Very similar to while loop but will run code inside of curly brackets at least **ONCE** if condition is false

#### For Loop 

- A for loop runs a counter as a condition and will run that condition for a specific number of times. 

#### Statements in For Loop 

1. Initializatin
2. Condition 
3. Update

#### While loops

**Will always run if the parentheses condition is TRUE**
