# This is my notes on Operators & Loops 

## Evaluating Conditions/Comparison Operators  

* Is equal to - ==

* Is not equal to- !=

* Strict equal to- ===

* Strict not equal to- !==

* Greater than- >

* Greater than or equal to- >=

* Less than- <

* Less than or equal to- <=

**All these conditions create **Booleans** which are true or false statements** 

## Logical Operators 

*Allows to compare the results of more than one comparison operator* 

### Here are some different logical operators

* **&&**- Logical and 
    - Tests more than one condition

* **||** Logical or
    - Tests at least one condition

* **!** Logical not 
    - Takes a single boolean value and inverts it
